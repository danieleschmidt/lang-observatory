# GitHub Actions Workflows

Due to permission restrictions, the GitHub Actions workflow files need to be created manually. Below are the three comprehensive workflows that should be added to `.github/workflows/`:

## 1. Continuous Integration (ci.yml)

This workflow handles code quality, testing, and validation on every push and pull request.

### Features:
- Code quality validation (ESLint, Prettier, YAML linting)
- Security scanning (Trivy, CodeQL, secrets detection)
- Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Helm chart validation and packaging
- Docker image building and security scanning
- Multi-stage validation with quality gates

### Key Jobs:
- `quality`: Code quality and linting
- `security`: Security scanning and vulnerability detection
- `helm`: Helm chart validation and testing
- `unit-tests`: Unit test execution with coverage
- `integration-tests`: Integration testing with services
- `docker`: Container building and security scanning
- `performance`: Load testing with k6
- `deployment-check`: Final validation before deployment

## 2. Continuous Deployment (cd.yml)

This workflow handles automated deployments to staging and production environments.

### Features:
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Environment-specific configuration
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Post-deployment validation
- SBOM generation for supply chain security
- Comprehensive monitoring integration

### Key Jobs:
- `strategy`: Deployment strategy determination
- `build`: Container image building and pushing
- `package`: Helm chart packaging with version updates
- `deploy-staging`: Staging environment deployment
- `deploy-production`: Production deployment with blue-green strategy
- `security-staging`: Security validation in staging
- `monitoring`: Post-deployment health monitoring

## 3. Security Scanning (security.yml)

This workflow provides comprehensive security scanning and compliance checking.

### Features:
- Daily automated security scans
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security validation
- Infrastructure security checking
- Secrets detection and prevention
- SBOM generation and license compliance

### Key Jobs:
- `dependency-scan`: NPM audit and Snyk scanning
- `container-scan`: Trivy and Grype container scanning
- `infrastructure-scan`: Kubesec, Checkov, and Kics scanning
- `secrets-scan`: TruffleHog and GitLeaks detection
- `codeql`: Static code analysis
- `sbom`: Software Bill of Materials generation
- `compliance`: License and compliance checking

## Manual Setup Instructions

To add these workflows to your repository:

1. Create the `.github/workflows/` directory in your repository
2. Create three files: `ci.yml`, `cd.yml`, and `security.yml`
3. Copy the respective workflow content from the original implementation
4. Ensure proper repository secrets are configured:
   - `KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING`: Base64 encoded kubeconfig for staging
   - `KUBE_CONFIG_PRODUCTION`: Base64 encoded kubeconfig for production
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK`: Slack webhook URL for notifications
   - `SECURITY_SLACK_WEBHOOK`: Security-specific Slack webhook
   - `SNYK_TOKEN`: Snyk API token for vulnerability scanning
   - `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`: GitLeaks license (optional)

## Workflow Triggers

- **CI Workflow**: Triggered on push to main/develop branches and pull requests
- **CD Workflow**: Triggered on push to main, tags starting with 'v', and manual dispatch
- **Security Workflow**: Triggered daily at 2 AM UTC, on push/PR, and manual dispatch

## Integration with SDLC

These workflows integrate with all the development tools and processes established:

- **Pre-commit hooks** validate locally before CI
- **Makefile commands** mirror CI operations for local testing
- **Docker and container** strategies align with deployment patterns
- **Health checks and monitoring** validate deployment success
- **Security scanning** ensures continuous compliance

The workflows provide comprehensive automation for the entire software development lifecycle while maintaining security, quality, and reliability standards.
