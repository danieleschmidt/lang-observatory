## ‚ö° Quick Start

### üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/terragon-labs/photon-neuromorphics-sdk.git
cd photon-neuromorphics-sdk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize neuromorphic components
node examples/quickstart.js
```

### üíª Basic Usage

```javascript
const { LangObservatory } = require('./src/index');

// Initialize with neuromorphic capabilities
const observatory = new LangObservatory({
    photon: {
        maxNeurons: 1000,           // Neural network size
        quantumCoherence: 0.85      // Quantum coherence level
    },
    neuromorphic: {
        realTimeProcessing: true,    // Enable real-time processing
        learningEnabled: true        // Enable adaptive learning
    }
});

await observatory.initialize();

// Record LLM call with neuromorphic analysis
const result = await observatory.recordLLMCall(
    'openai',                    // Provider
    'gpt-4',                     // Model  
    { prompt: 'Your prompt', tokens: 150 },
    { response: 'AI response', tokens: 200 },
    { duration: 2000, cost: 0.05, quality: 0.9 }
);

// Access neuromorphic insights
console.log('Adaptive Score:', result.neuromorphicInsights.adaptiveRecommendations.adaptiveScore);
console.log('Quantum Coherence:', result.neuromorphicInsights.neuromorphicResult.quantumStates);
```
