# CI/CD Setup Instructions

## GitHub Actions Workflows

**Note: As per security guidelines, I cannot create GitHub Actions workflows directly. These should be manually created by the repository maintainer.**

### Required Workflows

#### 1. Pull Request Validation (`.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml`)

```yaml
name: PR Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - name: Set up Helm
        uses: azure/setup-helm@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test

  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          scan-type: 'fs'
          scan-ref: '.'
```

#### 2. Build and Package (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)

```yaml
name: Build and Package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  release:
    types: [ published ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Helm
        uses: azure/setup-helm@v3
      - name: Package Helm Chart
        run: helm package charts/lang-observatory
      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: helm-chart
          path: '*.tgz'
```

#### 3. Security Scanning (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

```yaml
name: Security Scanning

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 1'

jobs:
  codeql:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Initialize CodeQL
        uses: github/codeql-action/init@v3
      - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v3
```

## Branch Protection Rules

Configure the following branch protection rules for the `main` branch:

1. **Require pull request reviews**: 1 reviewer minimum
2. **Require status checks**: All CI checks must pass
3. **Require branches to be up to date**: Yes
4. **Restrict pushes to matching branches**: Yes
5. **Allow force pushes**: No
6. **Allow deletions**: No

## Required Repository Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided
- `REGISTRY_USERNAME`: Container registry username
- `REGISTRY_PASSWORD`: Container registry password/token

## Repository Settings

1. Enable vulnerability alerts
2. Enable dependency graph
3. Enable Dependabot security updates
4. Configure code scanning with CodeQL
