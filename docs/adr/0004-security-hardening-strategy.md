# ADR-0004: Security Hardening Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Lang Observatory handles sensitive LLM operational data including API keys, usage metrics, and potentially sensitive prompts/responses. As an observability platform, it requires comprehensive security hardening to protect against data breaches, unauthorized access, and ensure compliance with enterprise security requirements.

The platform integrates multiple components (Langfuse, OpenLIT, Prometheus, Grafana) each with their own security considerations, requiring a unified security approach.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive security hardening strategy with the following components:

1. **Pod Security Standards**: Enforce restricted Pod Security Standards across all components
2. **Network Policies**: Implement fine-grained network segmentation
3. **RBAC**: Strict role-based access control for Kubernetes resources
4. **Secret Management**: External secret management integration (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
5. **mTLS**: Mutual TLS for all inter-service communication
6. **Admission Controllers**: OPA Gatekeeper policies for security compliance
7. **Runtime Security**: Falco integration for runtime threat detection
8. **Supply Chain Security**: SLSA compliance and SBOM generation

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Enhanced security posture suitable for enterprise environments
- Compliance with SOC2, ISO 27001, and other security frameworks
- Reduced attack surface through defense-in-depth approach
- Audit trail for all security-relevant events
- Automated security policy enforcement

### Negative Consequences

- Increased complexity in deployment and operations
- Additional resource overhead for security components
- More complex troubleshooting when security policies block legitimate traffic
- Longer initial setup time due to security configuration

## Implementation

### Phase 1: Core Security (Immediate)
- Implement Pod Security Standards
- Deploy network policies
- Configure RBAC
- Enable audit logging

### Phase 2: Advanced Security (Next Release)
- Integrate external secret management
- Implement mTLS
- Deploy OPA Gatekeeper
- Add Falco monitoring

### Phase 3: Compliance (Future)
- SLSA compliance implementation
- SOC2 readiness
- Automated compliance reporting

## Alternatives Considered

- **Basic Security Only**: Rely only on Kubernetes default security features
  - Rejected: Insufficient for enterprise requirements
- **Third-party Security Platform**: Use external security platform like Twistlock/Prisma
  - Rejected: Adds external dependency and cost
- **Service Mesh Security**: Use Istio/Linkerd for all security features
  - Rejected: Too heavy for single-purpose observability platform
