# ADR-0005: Data Retention and Lifecycle Management Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Lang Observatory collects and stores multiple types of data with different retention requirements:

- **Traces and Spans**: High-volume, detailed execution data from LLM applications
- **Metrics**: Time-series data for monitoring and alerting
- **Logs**: Application and system logs for debugging
- **Cost Data**: Financial tracking information for LLM usage

Different data types have varying value over time, storage costs, and compliance requirements. Without proper lifecycle management, storage costs will grow unbounded and performance will degrade.

## Decision

Implement a tiered data retention strategy with automated lifecycle management:

### Retention Tiers

1. **Hot Tier (0-7 days)**
   - All data types available for real-time queries
   - High-performance storage (SSD)
   - Full search and analytics capabilities

2. **Warm Tier (7-90 days)**
   - Aggregated metrics and summarized traces
   - Standard storage performance
   - Limited search capabilities, optimized for dashboards

3. **Cold Tier (90 days - 2 years)**
   - Compressed historical data for compliance
   - Low-cost storage (object storage)
   - Archive format, batch access only

4. **Archive/Delete (> 2 years)**
   - Configurable per data type
   - Optional long-term archive or permanent deletion

### Data-Specific Policies

- **Traces**: 7 days hot, 30 days warm, 1 year cold
- **Metrics**: 30 days hot, 6 months warm, 2 years cold
- **Logs**: 3 days hot, 14 days warm, 6 months cold
- **Cost Data**: 90 days hot, 2 years warm, 7 years cold (compliance)

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- Predictable and manageable storage costs
- Maintained query performance through data tiering
- Compliance with data retention regulations
- Automated maintenance reduces operational overhead
- Clear data lifecycle visibility for users

### Negative Consequences

- Complex storage infrastructure requirements
- Data migration overhead between tiers
- Potential data loss if retention policies are misconfigured
- Limited historical analysis capabilities for archived data

## Implementation

### Technical Components

1. **Storage Classes**
   - High-performance storage class for hot data
   - Standard storage class for warm data
   - Object storage integration for cold data

2. **Data Migration Jobs**
   - Kubernetes CronJobs for automated data movement
   - Incremental data compression and archival
   - Verification and rollback capabilities

3. **Retention Policy Engine**
   - Configurable policies per tenant/namespace
   - Policy validation and enforcement
   - Audit logging for all lifecycle actions

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Storage utilization monitoring
   - Data migration job health
   - Policy compliance reporting

### Configuration Example

```yaml
dataRetention:
  global:
    hotTierDays: 7
    warmTierDays: 90
    coldTierYears: 2
  
  traces:
    hotTierDays: 7
    warmTierDays: 30
    coldTierYears: 1
    compressionEnabled: true
  
  metrics:
    hotTierDays: 30
    warmTierDays: 180
    coldTierYears: 2
    aggregationRules:
      - interval: "5m"
        retention: "7d"
      - interval: "1h"
        retention: "90d"
      - interval: "1d"
        retention: "2y"
```

## Alternatives Considered

- **Single Tier Storage**: Keep all data in same storage class
  - Rejected: Prohibitive cost for long-term retention
- **Time-based Deletion Only**: Simple deletion after fixed period
  - Rejected: Loses valuable historical data for analytics
- **Manual Data Management**: Admin-controlled data lifecycle
  - Rejected: Operationally intensive and error-prone
