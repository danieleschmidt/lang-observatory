# ADR-0001: Adopt Architecture Decision Records Process

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As the lang-observatory project grows in complexity, we need a way to document
significant architectural decisions, their context, and their consequences.
Without proper documentation of decisions, team members (both current and
future) lack understanding of why certain choices were made, leading to:

- Repeated discussions about already-decided topics
- Inconsistent architectural patterns
- Difficulty onboarding new team members
- Loss of institutional knowledge

## Decision

We will adopt Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as our standard process for
documenting architectural decisions. This includes:

1. Creating an ADR for any significant architectural decision
2. Using a standardized template for consistency
3. Storing ADRs in the `docs/adr/` directory
4. Requiring ADR review as part of the PR process for architectural changes
5. Maintaining an index of all ADRs

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved transparency**: All team members can understand the reasoning
  behind architectural decisions
- **Better onboarding**: New team members can quickly understand the project's
  architectural history
- **Reduced repeated discussions**: Decisions are documented with their
  rationale
- **Historical context**: Future teams can understand why decisions were made
  given the constraints at the time
- **Consistency**: Standardized format makes decisions easy to find and
  understand

### Negative Consequences

- **Additional overhead**: Creating ADRs requires time and effort
- **Maintenance burden**: ADRs need to be kept up-to-date when decisions are
  superseded
- **Process compliance**: Team needs to remember to create ADRs for significant
  decisions

## Implementation

1. Create ADR directory structure in `docs/adr/`
2. Create ADR template based on Michael Nygard's format
3. Document this decision as the first ADR
4. Add ADR creation to definition of done for architectural changes
5. Include ADR review in PR template checklist

## Alternatives Considered

- **Option 1**: Use wiki pages - Rejected because wikis are separate from code
  and harder to version control
- **Option 2**: Use comments in code - Rejected because architectural decisions
  span multiple files and components
- **Option 3**: Use GitHub issues - Rejected because issues are for tracking
  work, not documenting decisions
