# Lang Observatory Project Charter

## Project Vision

Lang Observatory delivers a turnkey, enterprise-ready observability stack specifically designed for Large Language Model (LLM) applications, enabling organizations to gain comprehensive visibility into their AI workloads through seamless Kubernetes deployment.

## Problem Statement

Organizations deploying LLM applications face critical observability challenges:

- **Fragmented Monitoring**: LLM applications require specialized metrics (token usage, model performance, cost tracking) that traditional monitoring stacks don't provide
- **Complex Integration**: Setting up comprehensive observability requires integrating multiple tools (tracing, metrics, dashboards) with significant configuration overhead
- **Operational Visibility Gaps**: Limited insight into LLM-specific performance characteristics, usage patterns, and cost optimization opportunities
- **Deployment Complexity**: No standardized, production-ready solution for deploying complete LLM observability in Kubernetes environments

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Turnkey Helm Chart**: Complete observability stack deployment with minimal configuration
- **Integrated Tooling**: Langfuse (tracing), OpenLIT (telemetry), Prometheus (metrics), Grafana (visualization)
- **LLM-Specific Monitoring**: Token usage, model performance, cost tracking, conversation analytics
- **Production-Ready Configuration**: Security, scalability, and operational best practices
- **Unified Root-Cause Analysis**: Correlated observability data across the entire LLM application stack
- **Documentation & Best Practices**: Comprehensive deployment and operational guidance

### Out of Scope
- **Model Training Observability**: Focus is on inference/serving observability, not training pipelines
- **Custom Model Development**: Observability for model development workflows
- **Multi-Cloud Deployment**: Initial focus on Kubernetes-native deployment
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Basic authentication included, enterprise SSO as future enhancement

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Deployment Simplicity**: Single `helm install` command deploys fully functional observability stack
2. **Time to Value**: Complete visibility into LLM applications within 15 minutes of deployment
3. **Operational Readiness**: Production-grade security, monitoring, and maintenance capabilities
4. **Community Adoption**: Active user community with contributions and feedback

### Technical Success Criteria
- **Helm Chart Quality**: Passes all lint tests, follows Helm best practices
- **Documentation Completeness**: 95%+ coverage of deployment and operational scenarios
- **Security Compliance**: Implements Pod Security Standards, network policies, RBAC
- **Performance**: Handles 10,000+ traces/minute with <100ms latency impact
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for observability stack components

### Business Success Criteria
- **User Adoption**: 100+ organizations using in production within 6 months
- **Community Engagement**: 50+ GitHub stars, 10+ contributors within 3 months
- **Industry Recognition**: Featured in observability or LLM industry publications
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Listed in major Kubernetes/Helm repositories

## Stakeholder Alignment
