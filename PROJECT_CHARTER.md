# Lang Observatory Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Lang Observatory  
**Project Code**: LANG-OBS  
**Project Type**: Open Source Infrastructure  
**Start Date**: January 2025  
**Current Phase**: Production (v0.1.0)  

## Problem Statement

Large Language Model (LLM) applications in production environments lack comprehensive observability solutions that understand the unique characteristics of AI workloads. Traditional monitoring tools fail to capture LLM-specific metrics such as token usage, model performance, cost attribution, and trace correlation across complex AI pipelines.

## Project Vision

To create the definitive, turnkey observability stack for LLM applications that provides developers and operators with comprehensive insights into their AI workloads, enabling optimal performance, cost efficiency, and reliability.

## Project Mission

Lang Observatory delivers a production-ready Helm chart that seamlessly integrates best-in-class observability tools (Langfuse, OpenLIT, Prometheus, Grafana) into a unified platform specifically designed for LLM applications running in Kubernetes environments.

## Business Case

### Market Opportunity
- **Growing LLM Adoption**: 300%+ growth in production LLM applications
- **Operational Challenges**: 80% of AI projects fail due to operational complexity
- **Cost Optimization**: Average LLM operational costs can be reduced by 30-50% with proper observability
- **Compliance Requirements**: Increasing regulatory requirements for AI observability

### Value Proposition
- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Reduce observability setup from weeks to hours
- **Cost Optimization**: Detailed cost tracking and optimization recommendations
- **Operational Excellence**: Proactive monitoring and alerting for LLM workloads
- **Unified Platform**: Single pane of glass for all LLM observability needs
